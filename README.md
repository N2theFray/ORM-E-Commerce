## Lessons and musings
This project went as expected. The source file was given had much of the logic required for the project. The main focus of the project was to emphasize the use of ORM (object relational mapping) Sequlize to alleviate the the manual programming of the MySQL database. This worked out swimmingly as sequilize did a great job of organizing material easily. I didn't face many problems outside of a few syntax errors on my part, but throwing the catch err's were able to identify the problems readily.
